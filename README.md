          School District Analysis Challange
For this Challange we were tasked with examining student test scores from multiple schools within an area. The schools were subset by type(Charter,District), size, grade, and budget to gain a further understanding on the scores recieved by students in math and reading. The math and reading data was used to determine scores for each school grouped by type, size, grade and budget. Furthermore, data regarding Thomas High School(THS) 9th grade students was in need of cleaning. This cleaning was performed and then compared and contrasted with the data containing the THS 9th grade classes grades. 

Results
